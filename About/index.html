          <h2>Me</h2>
          <p>
              I'm a college student majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently working towards going into Software Engineering or Cybersecurity. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, pickleball, and occasionally touching grass. Checkout my github to see some of my newer projects.

          <h2>My Games</h2>
          <p>
              I started making games almost ten years ago when I joined a local coding club, and most of my pasts games can be found on this very website. My past games were made with, Scratch, Khan Academy's ProcessingJS language, P5JS, and the Unity game engine.
          </p>
          <h2>This Site</h2>
          <p>
              This site was made using a domain from freenom, and was put on the internet using netlify. I used libraries bootstrap, jquery, and popper to make this site.
