          <h2>Me</h2>
          <p>
              I'm a highschooler who started learning to code in 2016. I like to make music, play pickleball and basketball, and start forest fires in my free time. I know javascript, html, css, nodejs, and C#. I mostly like making games on Unity and P5 with my sweet epic dank coding skills. Also, I made my username when I was 10 years old, I don't like it either.
          </p>
          <h2>My Games</h2>
          <p>
              My past games were made with, scratch, khan academy, and p5. I'm mostly using Unity to make my games right now, but I will occasionally use p5.
              Don't attempt to play these games on mobile, it probably won't go well.
          </p>
          <h2>This Site</h2>
          <p>
              This site was made using a domain from freenom, and was put on the internet using netlify. I used libraries bootstrap, jquery, and popper to make this site.
